In python All are objects in python/not a premitive type
 "python"------>>> "python".upper() can call in method 
 
 Its a dynamically typed language,
No need to give data type before giving nujmber

Its Strongly typed : cannot add text and numbers but in java we can do this process
IN python there is no upper limit (Only computer menory is the max) --- in java max int size is there

It supports decimal,float,hexadecimal binary

https://www.vedantu.com/maths/bodmas-rule--------read this basics 
difference between float and decimal 
float 0.2+0.1======0.30000000000004   this inaccuaracy problem in all languages (in finance it makes bigger issue)
decimal=0.2+0.1======0.3 right answer 
 
 
 ' Python'.strip().capitalize()--can use one method output to another method input-its called chaining
 
 string ia a sequence object ()its in order
 
 variable----it identify the location in the memory
 variable name should contain number letters and underscore (So that interpreter will not get confused),spaces are not allowed.
 variable name is a identifier
 variable will create automatically when we assign the value(in java ,c -- need to declare the value and it stored some value if its undefined)
 
 
 no need to terminate the line using :; like java c
 
 
 append will consider the new elemnet  as single element and append it
 extend -will add one by one into the existing list
 ['list of values']-----.sort()  will change the original value
 
 sorted(list)-will show the sorted list and its not short the original value
 
 .join()
  will convert listinto string and string into list

  Siemens senior Data Scientist Interview Questions:
  
  1.what init function will do:
  
  2.what is self and what is the prupose:
  
  3.what is the purpose of main function what it will do
  in java void main is the strating point of the code, like wise main in python will give the starting point 
  if --name--: --main--
   demo()
   demo1()
   demo()
   we can mention in the order of the code so that we can understand the code easily
  4.how to trigger your machine learning model
  5.if deployment code in large how do you split the file in different function (each function has same load like this....)
  6.while managing a team which is first preference (time maintenance or quality of the model and code)
  7.abs constructor in class ---did u used this
  8.what kind of format u r using for model developement and deployment (like func or class or anything else)
  9.how to stroe the trained model ---ans: pickle and PMML
  10.

  OOPs concept:
  #########  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U19qSnU3vo&list=LL8pANGQnYGeOyT_PGzw3G2w&index=8&t=0s
  python and java is the interpreter language
  
  interpreter includes compiler and byte code and  virtual machine ---it runs each line and gives output
  
  c c++  ----compiler language
  whole program check the syntax and convert into machine language and gives output
  
  
  OOOPS concet SAntra Techspot 
  
  
  before ooops -- Function oriented method (Procedure oriented program)used for programming 
  it converts long code into multiple functions
  drawback ---after running all codes we will get error.
  
  oops four pillars
  inheritance, encapsulation, Abstraction, polymorphism
  
  oops developement is new programming style 
  it converts big code into small units called object
  
  oops:
  object
  class
  data abstraction
  data encapsulation
  polymorphism
  inheritance
  dynamic binding message passing
  
  
  class sample():
   def sum(a,b)
   return a+b
   
   obj=sample()
   obj=sample.sum(a,b)

So calling the one set of work progrees in class format is called object
object can include multiple classes.
