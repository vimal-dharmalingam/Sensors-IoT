In python All are objects in python/not a premitive type
 "python"------>>> "python".upper() can call in method 
 
 Its a dynamically typed language,
No need to give data type before giving nujmber

Its Strongly typed : cannot add text and numbers but in java we can do this process
IN python there is no upper limit (Only computer menory is the max) --- in java max int size is there

It supports decimal,float,hexadecimal binary

https://www.vedantu.com/maths/bodmas-rule--------read this basics 
difference between float and decimal 
float 0.2+0.1======0.30000000000004   this inaccuaracy problem in all languages (in finance it makes bigger issue)
decimal=0.2+0.1======0.3 right answer 
 
 
 ' Python'.strip().capitalize()--can use one method output to another method input-its called chaining
 
 string ia a sequence object ()its in order
 
 variable----it identify the location in the memory
 variable name should contain number letters and underscore (So that interpreter will not get confused),spaces are not allowed.
 variable name is a identifier
 variable will create automatically when we assign the value(in java ,c -- need to declare the value and it stored some value if its undefined)
 
 
 no need to terminate the line using :; like java c
 
 
 append will consider the new elemnet  as single element and append it
 extend -will add one by one into the existing list
 ['list of values']-----.sort()  will change the original value
 
 sorted(list)-will show the sorted list and its not short the original value
 
 .join()
  will convert listinto string and string into list
